# 👋 Hi, I’m Edward Jensen (@edwardjensen)

- 👀 I’m interested in systems administration and automation within the lens of nonprofit organizations.
- 🌱 I’m currently reacquainting myself with Powershell, and learning .NET and C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other IT professionals in the nonprofit sphere in Minnesota.

More to come later, but for now, here's a photo of Minneapolis's Stone Arch Bridge from April 2022

## Current projects and technological musings include

- 🏢 Development of IT policies and procedures, especially when it comes to employee offboarding and enterprise data protection.
- 🛻 Automation to support my cardinal rule of IT processes, which is to separate the person from the process
- 📝 Scripting and integration with other enterprise tools to streamline IT's role in employee onboarding and offboarding.
- 📰 And after many false starts, I'm finally getting around to revisiting the technology stack behind my blog, [edwardjensen.net](https://www.edwardjensen.net/), so it's not based on a monolithic WordPress instance, but something more cloudy (and less expensive!).
