# Edward Jensen

Nonprofit IT practitioner based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Fifteen-plus years leading technology functions at mission-driven organizations, with a focus on institutional resilience, systems integration, and making IT work as a mission multiplier rather than a cost center.

I think of technology—including AI—as tools in a toolbox, not the toolbox itself. The interesting questions are rarely about whether to adopt something, but about when a particular tool fits a particular problem. Most of my repositories here are private (version control for configuration, internal tooling, and experiments that are not ready for daylight), but the public ones reflect what I am building and how I think about it.
