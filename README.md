# Edward Jensen

Nonprofit IT practitioner based in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Fifteen-plus years leading technology functions at mission-driven organizations, with a focus on institutional resilience, systems integration, and making IT work as a mission multiplier rather than a cost center.

I think of technology—including AI—as tools in a toolbox, not the toolbox itself. The interesting questions are rarely about whether to adopt something, but about when a particular tool fits a particular problem. Most of my repositories here are private (version control for configuration, internal tooling, and experiments that are not ready for daylight), but the public ones reflect what I am building and how I think about it.

_You do not need to become a software developer to benefit from understanding how software development works. Here is what an accidental software developer learned—and why it might be useful to you, too._

_AI-assisted development is not about letting the AI take the wheel. The value comes from your ability to direct it effectively, and to recognize when it is heading in the wrong direction._

**[THANKSGIVING GREETINGS](https://www.edwardjensen.net/posts/2025/2025-11/thanksgiving-greetings) (26 November 2025)**
