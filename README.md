# 👋 Hi, I’m Edward Jensen (@edwardjensen).

- 👀 I’m interested in systems administration and automation within the lens of nonprofit organizations.
- 🌱 I’m currently reacquainting myself with Powershell, and learning .NET and C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other IT professionals in the nonprofit sphere in Minnesota.

More to come later, but for now, here's a photo of Minneapolis's Stone Arch Bridge from April 2022
